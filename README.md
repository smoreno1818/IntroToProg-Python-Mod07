## Pickle Research

In this module, I made two functions to read and write binary files, called `save_data_to_file` and `read_data_from_file`

output:

## Exception Handling Research
In python there are two main keywords used to handle exceptions, called
- `try`
- `except`

Here's a function I wrote to test exception handling:
```
try:
    z = 1000 / 0
    print(z)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("my zero division error")
print("done")
```
